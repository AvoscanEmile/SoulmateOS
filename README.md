# SoulmateOS

SoulmateOS is a minimalist, highly customizable Linux environment based on AlmaLinux Minimal. It features the Awesome Window Manager (AwesomeWM) combined with a carefully curated selection of lightweight, robust packages to create an elegant and efficient desktop experience.

This project embraces a philosophy of simplicity, security, and personalization. Rather than adopting heavy, monolithic desktop environments, SoulmateOS focuses on building a modular and cohesive user interface tailored to the needs and preferences of an advanced user. The goal is to deliver a performant system with a strong emphasis on maintainability and reproducibility.

Key objectives include:

- Starting from a minimal AlmaLinux base to ensure stability and compatibility with enterprise-grade software.
- Installing and configuring AwesomeWM as the primary window manager to provide a flexible, keyboard-driven workflow.
- Selecting and integrating essential desktop components (such as terminal emulators, file managers, network tools, and multimedia utilities) with a focus on minimal resource usage and visual coherence.
- Implementing robust security configurations that balance protection with performance and usability.
- Creating an easily reinstallable system setup through automated scripts and configuration management, enabling quick deployment and version control.

This repository contains the configuration files, themes, setup scripts, and documentation required to replicate and customize the SoulmateOS environment.
