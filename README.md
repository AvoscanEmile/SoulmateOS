# SoulmateOS

SoulmateOS is a minimalist, highly customizable Linux environment meticulously crafted from a minimal AlmaLinux base. It integrates the powerful Qtile Window Manager with a carefully curated selection of lightweight, robust packages, aiming to deliver an elegant, efficient, and deeply personalized desktop experience.

## Philosophy

At its core, SoulmateOS is designed to be more than just an operating system; it's a long-term companion for users who desire total control and transparency over their computing environment. It fosters a philosophy of:

  * **Learning-by-building**: Encouraging users to grow alongside the system by manually configuring each layer.

  * **Long-term Cohabitation**: Built to minimize churn and avoid frequent overhauls, promoting stability.

  * **Trust through Transparency**: All components are scriptable, versioned, and intentionally selected, ensuring users understand system behavior.

  * **Sane Defaults**: While fully customizable, it comes with an aesthetically harmonized and carefully chosen collection of packages.

This vision transforms SoulmateOS into a trusted and extensible digital habitat. For a deeper dive into the architectural decisions, component selection, and security considerations that underpin this philosophy, please refer to the comprehensive [`architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) document.

## Quick Installation

For a rapid setup of SoulmateOS on a fresh AlmaLinux 9.6 minimal installation, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git
git clone https://github.com/avoscanemile/soulmateos
bash soulmateos/install/installation.sh
```

**Note:** This is a quick guide. For detailed installation instructions, system requirements, and customization options, please refer to the comprehensive [`install/README.md`](./install/README.md).

## Key Objectives & Features

SoulmateOS is built upon several key objectives, focusing on performance, security, and user empowerment:

  * **Minimalist Base**: Starting from a minimal AlmaLinux 9.6 installation ensures enterprise-grade stability, predictable lifecycles, and compatibility with robust RPM ecosystem tools.

  * **Qtile Window Manager**: Leveraging Qtile as the primary window manager provides a flexible, keyboard-driven workflow that is fully customizable with Python, offering high performance and extensibility.

  * **Curated Application Stack**: Instead of monolithic desktop environments, SoulmateOS integrates essential desktop components (terminal emulators, file managers, network tools, multimedia utilities) chosen for their minimal resource usage, functional completeness, and visual coherence.

      * **Core Apps**: Kitty (terminal), Rofi (app launcher), Thunar (file manager), Geany (text editor), btop (system monitor), GNOME Disk Utility.

      * **User Apps**: Firefox (web browser), Celluloid (media player), Lollypop (music player), gThumb (image viewer), Engrampa (archive manager), Evince/Foliate (document viewers), Calcurse (calendar/PIM).

      * **UX Enhancers**: `xfce4-clipman` (clipboard manager), `xfce4-notifyd` (notification daemon), `xfce4-screenshooter` (screenshot tool), and custom Eww widgets for volume control.

  * **Robust Security Configurations**: Implementation of a lightweight yet strong security baseline, including SELinux in enforcing mode, `firewalld` configuration, and other hardening measures.

  * **Reproducibility & Automation**: Designed for easy reinstallation and deployment through automated Bash/Ansible scripts and Git-versioned dotfiles, ensuring quick setup and version control.

  * **Unified Theming**: A consistent visual aesthetic across all GTK-based applications, Polybar, and Eww widgets, controlled centrally via CSS.

## Project Structure Overview

The SoulmateOS repository is organized to facilitate clarity, modularity, and ease of management:

  * **`install/`**: Contains the main `installation.sh` script and modular scripts for setting up the base system, graphics, Qtile, user applications, and configuration deployment.

  * **`config/`**: Houses all the configuration files for Qtile, Picom, GTK, Polybar, and Eww. These are the dotfiles that define the system's behavior and appearance.

  * **`themes/`**: Stores theme-related variables and assets, particularly for Polybar, ensuring a centralized approach to visual consistency.

  * **`docs/`**: This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the project, including:

      * **`architecture.md`**: A detailed outline of the project's design philosophy, component selection rationale, security goals, and file intercorrelations.
      * **`roadmap.md`**: A structured, modular plan outlining the project's development phases, from initial setup to future meta-distro capabilities and "rice" management.
      * **`README.md` (this file)**: Provides a high-level overview of the entire project.

  * **`devlogs/`**: Contains development logs documenting the project's progress and decisions throughout the development process.

## Roadmap & Future Vision

SoulmateOS follows a structured roadmap, evolving from a robust AlmaLinux-based environment towards a cross-distribution meta-distro platform with advanced "rice" (configuration) management capabilities. Key phases include:

  * **Current State (v1.0.0)**: A stable, AlmaLinux-based environment with a polished Qtile desktop, curated applications, and initial security hardening.

  * **Meta-Distro Development (v1.1.0 - v1.3.0)**: Research and implementation of cross-distribution compatibility, enabling SoulmateOS to be installed and run on other major Linux distributions (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch).

  * **"Rice" Management System (v1.4.0 - v1.5.0)**: Development of `install-rice` and `create-rice` commands to standardize the packaging, sharing, and installation of user-contributed configuration "rices."

  * **Robustness & Usability Refinement (v1.6.0)**: Enhancing error handling, idempotency, and user interaction for both the installer and "rice" management system.

  * **Community & Ecosystem Foundation (v1.7.0)**: Fostering a community around SoulmateOS "rices" and comprehensive documentation for the meta-distro capabilities.

  * **SoulmateOS 2.0.0 Final Release**: The culmination of the meta-distro and "rice" management efforts, marking a significant milestone in the project's evolution.

For a detailed breakdown of each phase, please refer to the [`roadmap.md`](./docs/roadmap.md) file.
